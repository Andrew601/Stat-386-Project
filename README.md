# Stat 386 Final Prject

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to help answer question regarding how the National Basketball Association (NBA) has changed and evolved offensively
over the last 20 years.

## Contents
There are a few files in the repository. The files titled "Data Scraping" and "Data Scraping 2" have all the code to grab and clean our data from the web.
There are two main datasets in this repository. The first being "LeagueStats". This dataset has offensive metrics by season for the last 20 years, the variables
include: FG, FGA, 3P, 3PA,	FT, FTA,	PTS,	FG%,	3P%,	FT%,	Pace, and ORtg.

The second, and much larger data set is titled "CombinedShotData" includes shot data from the 2002 and 2022 seasons of the NBA. It has the data for every shot taken by the top 5 scorers
from each season. This data set is made to help us look at distribution of shots from last year and 20 years ago. The variables include the following:
Date, Quarter (of the game), Top (y-coordinate on court of shot location) ,Left (x-coordinate on court of shot location), Result (make or miss),
Player, Distance (ft), ShotType (3-pointer or 2-pointer), Season (yr).
I also have seperated versions of the "CombinedDataSet", one for the 2002 season and one for the 2022 season.

This repository also contains the code to created visuals of the data that help answer question about how offense has changed in the NBA.
